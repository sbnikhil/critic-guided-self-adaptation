Original Q: రాపర్తి గ్రామ పిన్ కోడ్ ఏంటి?
Original A: 533445

Best edit number: 3
Critic approved: True
Critic score: 9.0
Critic reason: Edit 3 provides a comprehensive and accurate self-QA, extracting almost all factual information from the context into a clear question-answer format. This is highly useful for understanding and verifying the content. Edit 1 contains significant errors and subjective judgments. Edit 2 is a good rewrite but less comprehensive in demonstrating understanding than a full self-QA. Edit 4's 'implications' are mostly redundant restatements.
