The sandfly becomes infected when biting an infected human in the period between 48 hours before the onset of fever and 24 hours after the end of the fever, and remains infected for its lifetime. Besides this horizontal virus transmission from man to sandfly, the virus can be transmitted in insects transovarially, from an infected female sandfly to its offspring.Pappataci fever is seldom recognised in endemic populations because it is mixed with other febrile illnesses of childhood, but it is more well-known among immigrants and military personnel from non-endemic regions.",

Originating similarly to parenchymal precursors via meristematic origins, they swiftly diverge morphologically thereafter. No chloroplast formation occurs; instead, an enhanced production of internal structures like endoplasmic reticulum and golgi complexes facilitates extra foundational layers. Typically, these structures exhibit maximum density along junction points involving multiple cellular intersections whereas areas between dual contacts display reduced thicknesses. Various configurations exist regarding localized strengthening patterns within individual components. For many species belonging to the dicotyledons category under flowering plants, predominant elements consist of pectins alongside hemicelluloses with perhaps minimal inclusion of cellulose up until certain stages observed specifically during Petasites growth phases. Often extending linearly, some variants even undergo perpendicular divisions creating appearances reminiscent of segmented segments. Their main function revolves around offering mechanical assistance particularly useful when stems or leaf stalks continue expanding longitudinally, ensuring suppleness alongside resistance against stretching forces imposed upon them due to surrounding tissue expansion processes. Since lacking lignified substances responsible for hardness and firmness, such units supply flexible supportive functions essential throughout early developmental periods characterized by dynamic dimensional changes among neighboring cells. Describing their contribution through stretchable yet non-elastic mechanisms accurately captures key aspects associated with collenchymal activities present across diverse plant organs including celery fiber systems.\nYou're welcome!

These cells mature from meristem derivatives that initially resemble parenchyma, but differences quickly become apparent. Plastids do not develop, and the secretory apparatus (ER and Golgi) proliferates to secrete additional primary wall. The wall is most commonly thickest at the corners, where three or more cells come in contact, and thinnest where only two cells come in contact, though other arrangements of the wall thickening are possible. Pectin and hemicellulose are the dominant constituents of collenchyma cell walls of dicotyledon angiosperms, which may contain as little as 20% of cellulose in Petasites. Collenchyma cells are typically quite elongated, and may divide transversely to give a septate appearance. The role of this cell type is to support the plant in axes still growing in length, and to confer flexibility and tensile strength on tissues. The primary wall lacks lignin that would make it tough and rigid, so this cell type provides what could be called plastic support – support that can hold a young stem or petiole into the air, but in cells that can be stretched as the cells around them elongate. Stretchable support (without elastic snap-back) is a good way to describe what collenchyma does. Parts of the strings in celery are collenchyma.",

    "context": "Edgar Allan Poe (; born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and of American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. He is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.Poe was born in Boston, the second child of actors David and Elizabeth \"Eliza\" Arnold Hopkins Poe. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died the following year. Thus orphaned, the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia. They never formally adopted him, but he was with them well into young adulthood. Tension developed later as John Allan and Poe repeatedly clashed over debts, including those incurred by gambling, and the cost of Poe's secondary education. He attended the University of Virginia but left after a year due to lack of money. Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name. It was at this time that his publishing career began with the anonymous collection Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827), credited only to \"a Bostonian\". Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the death of Frances Allan in 1829. Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and he ultimately parted ways with John Allan.",

Rising temperatures can lead to reduced crop yields by accelerating plant development cycles, leading to premature ripening and decreased productivity. Additionally, changes in precipitation patterns result in more frequent droughts and floods which further stress crops and reduce harvest sizes. Increased CO2 levels might initially boost growth rates; however, this benefit diminishes when combined with high heat stress conditions typical under current warming trends. Adaptation strategies include developing new varieties resistant to extreme weather events along with improving irrigation techniques to manage water resources efficiently amidst variable climatic conditions.\n\nKey Points:\n1. Climate change causes rising temperatures affecting agricultural productivity through accelerated growing seasons causing earlier maturation.\n2. Variability in rainfall results in increased occurrences of droughts and floods impacting crop health negatively.\n3. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations could enhance plant growth yet lose efficacy under intense thermal stresses prevalent today.\n4.

Within each of these segments, there exist dual portions referred to as fields; specifically, one comprises roughly 262.5 horizontal divisions whereas its counterpart includes nearly identical units, culminating in an overall count close to five hundred twenty-five units across both fields collectively. Out of those totals, precisely four hundred eighty-six contribute directly towards viewable content leaving aside approximately fifteen unused sections utilized primarily for synchronizing processes alongside essential technical features like captions and timing codes during transmission intervals.

Here’s another attempt at rewriting the passage:\n\nIn North American broadcasting, the NTSC system employs System M to transmit colors via approximately thirty point nine-seven interlaced frames per second. These frames comprise two parts termed fields—each containing about two hundred sixty-two point five scanning lines—that together sum up to just under five hundred twenty-five total scans. Of these, exactly four hundred eighty-six form part of the actual picture area, leaving around fourteen extra rows dedicated to synchronization purposes and supplementary data like subtitles and VITC markers throughout blank periods. Originally intended solely for deactivating the screen to facilitate simpler hardware designs lacking advanced capabilities back then, recent improvements enable more complex functions within these regions today. Due to their sequential arrangement, every alternate line from one set appears before those from another, ensuring smooth motion portrayal",

NTSC stands for North American Television Standardization Committee protocols.\n2. Interlaced video signals consist of several fields combined into single frames.\n3. Approximately thirty effective frames per second result from standardized timings affecting playback speeds slightly below nominal counts.\n4. Around five hundred twenty-five total scan lines exist per frame, yet merely four hundred eighty-six provide visual information.\n5. Extra regions outside primary display zones serve historical sync functions but could potentially support modern features too.\n6. Specific drawing sequences alternate between even and odd numbered lines ensuring continuous movement appears less jerky visually.\n7.

    "context": "NTSC color encoding is used with the System M television signal, which consists of ​30⁄1.001 (approximately 29.97) interlaced frames of video per second. Each frame is composed of two fields, each consisting of 262.5 scan lines, for a total of 525 scan lines. 486 scan lines make up the visible raster. The remainder (the vertical blanking interval) allow for vertical synchronization and retrace. This blanking interval was originally designed to simply blank the receiver's CRT to allow for the simple analog circuits and slow vertical retrace of early TV receivers. However, some of these lines may now contain other data such as closed captioning and vertical interval timecode (VITC). In the complete raster (disregarding half lines due to interlacing) the even-numbered scan lines (every other line that would be even if counted in the video signal, e.g. {2, 4, 6, ..., 524}) are drawn in the first field, and the odd-numbered (every other line that would be odd if counted in the video signal, e.g. {1, 3, 5, ..., 525}) are drawn in the second field, to yield a flicker-free image at the field refresh frequency of ​60⁄1.001 Hz (approximately 59.94 Hz). For comparison, 576i systems such as PAL-B/G and SECAM use 625 lines (576 visible), and so have a higher vertical resolution, but a lower temporal resolution of 25 frames or 50 fields per second.",
